# Algorithms in C
University projects programmed in C and Assembly Language (NASM). Documented and optimized for optimal executable size.  
**Course**: Introductory programming (advanced group) (1st semester)  
**Degree**: Bachelor's at University of Warsaw    


## Abstract
This repository consist of several short programs written in C/C++.  
The goal of these projects was to write **readable, correct and well-documented code**.  
All solutions passed **100%** of the tests, having the optimal space and time complexity.  
_Detailed assignment descriptions translated to english can be found in respective .md files._
